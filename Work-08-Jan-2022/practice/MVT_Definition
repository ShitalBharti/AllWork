Example:

Website is consist of three things:

1. Layout (It consist of Html, css, javascript etc.)
2. Data   (It comes from database)
3. Business Logic (To connect this two things and performs operations we need business logic)

We need to separate these three things while developing web application, In Django we
called it as 'MVT'

1. Model refers to Data
2. Template refers to HTML, CSS etc.
3. User sends request to Django/Web-Applications through URL, URL then call to view.
    View will then interact with Model and template and send response.
