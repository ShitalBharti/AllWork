"""
Single dimensional array -> These arrays represent only one row or one column of elements.
Multi dimensional array -> These arrays represent more than one row and more than one column of elements.
            Syntax: marks = array([[1,2,3,4],
                                   [5,6,7,8],
                                   [9,10,11]])

Note:  Python doesn't support multi-dimensional array. But we can create multidimensional arrays using third party packages like numpy(numerical python)
