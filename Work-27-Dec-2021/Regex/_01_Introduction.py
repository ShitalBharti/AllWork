Need of Regular Expression:

-> Many a times, we are needed to extract required information from given data.
-> For example, we want to know the number of people who contacted us in the last month through Gmail
            ->  We want to phone no, of employees in a company whose names start with 'A'
            ->  We want to retrieve date of births of the patients in a hospital who joined for treatment for hypertension etc.
-> To get such information, we have to conduct searching operation on data.
-> Once we get required information we have to extract that data for futher use.
-> Regular Expressions are useful to perform such operations on data.

What is Regular Expression:

-> It is a string that contains special symbols and characters to find and extract information needed by us from given data.
-> It helps us to search, match, find, split information as per our requirement.
-> In python, regular expression are called as "regex".
