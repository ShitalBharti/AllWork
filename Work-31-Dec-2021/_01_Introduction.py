-> Data is very important for any Organization to continue its operations.
-> To store data we can use file or database.
-> Database is similar to file, but when we need to perform some operations on data.
    -> Example: modifying existing data, deleting unwanted data, retrieving data from database etc.
-> To perform such operations, a database comes with a software.
    -> This called as DBMS(Database Management System)
    -> Example DBMS: MySql, Oracle, Sybase, SQL server etc.

Advanatages of DBMS over Files:

Point1:
    -> If we go for files, we have to write a lot of programming.
    -> To store data, retrieve data, modify data, we need to write 3 different programs.
    -> If we use database we can perform these tasks without any programs.
    -> We have to give simply commands, Commands are written in SQL langugae(Structured Query Language)
Point2:
    -> Generally, each file will have different data. When there is no relationship between files, it is difficult to fulfill customer needs
    -> By using DBMS, we can relate different pieces of data together and can be access using keys concept easily.
Point3:
    -> Files are not so efficient in handling large volumes of data.
    -> It is difficult task to enter large data into a file or retrieving it from file.
    -> But, DBMS can handle large volumes of data efficiently and easily.
Point4:
    -> When multiple users are accessing data concurrently from same file, there are chances of wrong results or inconsitent changes to existing data.
    DBMS will take care of such problems.
Point5:
    -> Once the changes are made to file, we cannot roll back. In case of DBMS, we can restore the previous state of data throug rollback.
    -> files offer very less security, DBMS offers good protection for data.
