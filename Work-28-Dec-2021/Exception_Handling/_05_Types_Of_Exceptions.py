    2. ArithmeticError                                  Represents the base class for arithmetic errors like OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError, FloatingPointError
    3. AssertionError                                   Raised when an assert statement gives error
    4. AttributeError                                   Raised when an attribute reference of assignment fails.
    5. EOFError                                         Raised when input() function reaches end of file condition without reading any data
    6. FloatingPointError                               Raised when a floating point operation fails.
    7. GeneratorExit                                    Raised when generator's close() method is called.
    8. IOError                                          Raised when an input or output operation failed.
                                                            It raises when the file is opened is not found or when writing data disk is full.
    9.ImportError	                                    Raised when the imported module is not found.
    10. IndexError	                                    Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range.
    11. KeyError	                                    Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
    12. KeyboardInterrupt	                            Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (Ctrl+C or Delete).
    13. MemoryError	                                    Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
    14. NameError	                                    Raised when a variable is not found in local or global scope.
    15. NotImplementedError	                            Raised by abstract methods.
    16. OSError	                                        Raised when system operation causes system related error.
    17. OverflowError	                                Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.
    18. ReferenceError	                                Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage collected referent.
    19. RuntimeError	                                Raised when an error does not fall under any other category.
    20. StopIteration	                                Raised by next() function to indicate that there is no further item to be returned by iterator.
    21. SyntaxError	                                    Raised by parser when syntax error is encountered.
    22. IndentationError	                            Raised when there is incorrect indentation.
    23. TabError	                                    Raised when indentation consists of inconsistent tabs and spaces.
    24. SystemError	                                    Raised when interpreter detects internal error.
    25. SystemExit	                                    Raised by sys.exit() function.
    26. TypeError	                                    Raised when a function or operation is applied to an object of incorrect type.
    27. UnboundLocalError	                            Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable.
    28. ValueError	                                    Raised when a function gets an argument of correct type but improper value.
    29. ZeroDivisionError	                            Raised when the second operand of division or modulo operation is zero.
