"""
-> A thread represents a separate path of execution of a group of statements. A thread can be imagined as a light weight process that executes a group of statements.
-> The statements of every Python program are executed by a default thread called 'Main Thread'.
-> The current_thread().getName() method returns the name of currently running thread.
-> Executing the tasks only one at a time is called single tasking. Single tasking cannot use the processor time in efficient manner.
-> Executing more than one task at a time is called multitasking, Multitasking utilizes the process time in an optimum manner.
-> Multitasking is of 2 types: a) Process-based multitasking and b) Thread-based multitasking.
-> A running program is an example of a process.
-> PVM uses an internal global interpreter lock (GIL) that allows only a single thread to execute at any given moment. Thus GIL is thread-safe.
