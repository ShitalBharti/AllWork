-> Array represents a group of elements of same data type.
-> Arrays are highly useful to store and process groups of elements easily.
-> python arrays can increase or decrease their size in memory at runtime. No need to mention size.
-> arrays are of 2 types: 1d or single dimension, multi-dimensional arrays 2d or 3d arrays
-> python offers only 1d array. if we want to create multi dimensional arrays we need to use package numpy.
-> python array module is useful to create 1d array.
-> Syntax: arrayname = array(type code, [elements])
-> index :: position number of an element
-> slice :: piece of part of an array. Syntax: arrayname[start:stop:stride]
-> methods in an array, functions in an array, mathematical operations in an arrays, relational operators, aliasing, viewing
    copying etc.
-> reshape() method is useful to change a 1D array into 2d or 3d array.
-> matrix in an arrays.
