-> The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off.
-> When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run.
-> This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list.
